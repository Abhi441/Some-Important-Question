///////////////////////Q>Why we are using EntityFrameworkcore ,if .netcore become .net after .net5
.NET Core used to be a separate version of .NET, but starting from .NET 5, it became the main version of .NET and is just called .NET (no more "Core" in the name).

However, when it comes to Entity Framework, there are still two different versions:

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) – the newer, modern version built for .NET Core and now .NET 5+.
Entity Framework 6 (EF6) – the older version that was built for the older .NET Framework (mainly for Windows-based apps).
The key point is that EF Core (even though it has "Core" in the name) is the newer, better ORM and is the one you should use with .NET 5+, whereas EF6 is for older projects that still use the old .NET Framework.

In short:

EF Core = modern, fast, cross-platform (use this for new .NET 5+ apps).
EF6 = older, legacy (mainly for older .NET Framework apps).
